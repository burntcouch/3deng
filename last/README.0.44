//
//  Svgalib demos are included for testing your
//	display before trying my stuff out.  Sorry, I did NOT
//	include docs for svgalib itself.  This IS a work in progress
//	and if you want them THAT bad you should already have them
//	since this dist is no good to you without the appropriate
//	libraries, anyway. 
//  Speaking of which, you should have vga.h/vgagl.h/vgamouse.h etc.
//	in your include directory.  I WILL soon put some info in here
//	on how to obtain your own copy of svgalib, but so far I haven't
//	bothered to update MY version so I am by no means an expert on
//	finding and installing it.  Ah well.
//
//  In any case...  Run 'vgatest' and choose an appropriate mode. If 
//	any 32K modes show up (i.e. G640x480x32K or higher) you can
//	probably run my demos.  I have also included 'vga_reset', which
//	you may or may not need to get the auto-detect of you card to
//	work right.
//
//  For bug info..  see 3DEngine.doc
